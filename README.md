🍷 Wine Recommendation using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for personalized wine recommendations based on taste preferences, built using LangChain, LLMs, embedding models, and Streamlit. It leverages a curated dataset of 130K+ wine reviews to retrieve and generate human-like suggestions tailored to user input.
